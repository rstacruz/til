[Ansible](http://ansible.com) is a fantastic tool for provisioning servers. I personally prefer it over Chef, Puppet and Salt. Here's how to get an Ansible project started.

## Install Ansible

Ansible is officially available via `pip`.

```sh
brew install ansible            # OSX
[sudo] pip install ansible      # elsewhere
```

## Start your project

Make the directory. Put this under version control, preferrably.

```sh
~$ mkdir setup
~$ cd setup
```

## Create an inventory file

This is a list of hosts you want to manage, grouped into groups. (Hint: try
using 127.0.0.1 to deploy to your local machine)

```dosini
# ~/setup/hosts

[sites]
127.0.0.1
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.2
192.168.0.3
```

## Create your first Playbook

A playbook is just a YAML file.

```yaml
# ~/setup/playbook.yml

- hosts: 127.0.0.1
  user: root
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx
      apt: pkg=nginx state=present

    - name: start nginx every bootup
      service: name=nginx state=started enabled=yes

    - name: do something in the shell
      shell: echo hello > /tmp/abc.txt

    - name: install bundler
      gem: name=bundler state=latest
```

## Run it

Use the `ansible-playbook` command.

```sh
~/setup$ ls
hosts
playbook.yml
```

```sh
~/setup$ ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
PLAY [all] ********************************************************************

GATHERING FACTS ***************************************************************
ok: [127.0.0.1]

TASK: [install nginx] *********************************************************
ok: [127.0.0.1]

TASK: [start nginx every bootup] **********************************************
ok: [127.0.0.1]
...
```
