You can use `docker system prune` to remove unused Docker artifacts.

<Figure code>

```bash
# Remove containers, images, etc not used
# in the last 240 hours
docker system prune --filter --until=240h
```

```bash
# Remove unused volumes
docker volume prune
```

</Figure>

## How does it work?

### Deleting old things

Delete unused things using `docker system prune --filter until=240h`. This will remove old containers, images, cache files and networks.

```
$ docker system prune --filter until=240h

  WARNING! This will remove:
          - all stopped containers
          - all networks not used by at least one container
          - all dangling images
          - all dangling build cache
          - Elements to be pruned will be filtered with:
          - label={"until":{"240h":true}}

### Delete unused volumes

Now that you've deleted some containers, you may want to delete their associated volumes as well with `docker volume prune`.

```
$ docker volume prune

  WARNING! This will remove all local volumes not used by at least one container.
