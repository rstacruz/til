[styled-jsx] lets developers write CSS-in-JS in a more declarative fashion compared to other CSS-in-JS solutions. In my opinion, it leads to code that's easier to understand.

Before I tell you why I prefer _styled-jsx_, let's learn about some programming concepts&mdash;It'll all make sense later, trust me!

<NextBlock title="What does it mean to write 'more declarative' code?"></NextBlock>

## Imperative vs. declarative code

### Approach 1

There are two styles of expressing data. The most common way is to simply write it out as a data structure. We can call this a **declarative** style of writing, where we try to express logic without providing any instructions.

<Figure code title='declarative-example.json'>

```js
{
  "name": "my-js-package",
  "description": "A sample package",
  "author": "Rico Sta. Cruz"
}
```

</Figure>

### Approach 2

There are cases when this style may not be flexible enough, so some systems take an **imperative** approach. In contrast to the declarative style, it's a piece of code with instructions that runs procedurally. Here's an example of a Ruby [gem specification](https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/), which defines a Ruby package's metadata.

<Figure code title='imperative-example.rb'>

```rb
Gem::Specification.new do |spec|
  spec.name = 'my-ruby-gem'
  spec.summary = 'A sample package'
  spec.authors = ['Rico Sta. Cruz']
end
```

</Figure>

<NextBlock title="What's the difference?" />

## But they look the same!

Ruby's gem specification style is _imperative_ because we're issuing instructions that are to be ran sequentially. It can keep variables, call functions, and do all the things you can do in a Ruby program. Think of the Ruby gemspec as a program talking to the system:

```rb
# Step 1: Okay, computer. Build a new Gem specification.
Gem::Specification.new do |spec|

  # Step 2: Set the name to 'my-ruby-gem'.
  spec.name = 'my-ruby-gem'

  # Step 3: Set the summary to 'A sample package'.
  spec.summary = 'A sample package'
  spec.authors = ['Rico Sta. Cruz']

# Step 4: Finish building.
end
```

On the other hand, JavaScript's _declarative_ style isn't concerned with any instructions or control flow. It's not a piece of code that talks to your system, it's really just a table of keys and values.

## Imperative is powerful

Imperative style gives you the power to write expressions that you can't easily do with a declarative-style conventions. For instance, here's an example gem specification where the list of files are gathered via a system command (`git ls-files`).

```rb
Gem::Specification.new do |spec|
  spec.name = 'my-gem'
  spec.summary = 'This is my gem'
  spec.files = `git ls-files -z`.split("\x0")
end
```

<!-- "We'll run a system command (`git ls-files -z`) to generate a list of files rather than listing them out by hand." -->

<NextBlock title="What makes declarative-style different?"></NextBlock>

## Declarative is straightforward

In contrast, here's how it may be _declaratively_ defined in a JavaScript package's `package.json`. JavaScript's _declarative approach_ may be less flexible than the _imperative_ one, but the constraints of a JSON format makes things more predictable and easier to glance.

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.0.0",
    "redux": "^4.0.1"
  }
}
```

> **No instructions here.** The package.json format is really just a list of things, there are no imperative instructions to be executed.

<NextBlock title="What does this have to do with CSS?"></NextBlock>

## CSS is declarative

CSS is beautifully declarative. To write CSS is to write a list of rules, not a set of instructions. For instance, we would say _buttons are supposed to be blue_, rather than _turn all buttons to blue_.

```css
button {
  background: blue;
}
```

> **Declarative:** Writing "buttons are supposed to be blue" in CSS.

```js
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button')

Array.from(buttons).forEach((button) => {
  button.style.background = 'blue'
})
```

> **Imperative:** Writing "please turn all buttons to blue" in JavaScript.
> (Please don't do this.)

<NextBlock title="What about CSS-in-JS?"></NextBlock>

## A lot of CSS-in-JS is imperative

At first glance, we can say that most CSS-in-JS solutions require you to write in a declarative style, since it's mostly just taking CSS and putting it in JavaScript. Here's how you would define a blue button using [styled-components]:

```js
const Button = styled.a`
  background: blue;
`
```

> **Declarative CSS-in-JS:** No imperative logic here, right?

### Where it breaks down

However, how would you start making red `danger` buttons? With _styled-components_, you'll have to provide a function which returns a CSS fragment depending on how you would interpret `props`:

```js
const Button = styled.a`
  background: blue;

  ${(props) =>
    props.danger &&
    css`
      background: red;
    `};
`
```

> **Using styled-components:** Using some JavaScript logic to generate some CSS. That is, CSS-in-JS-in-CSS-in-JS.

### Interwoven CSS and JavaScript

We're now mixing the declarative nature of CSS with some rules that are written in an imperative style. We're also now interweaving 2 languages together&mdash;CSS and JavaScript&mdash;where your brain may have to switch contexts mid-way.

###

```js
const Button = styled.a`
  background: ${(props) => (props.danger ? 'red' : 'blue')};
  opacity: ${(props) => (props.isHidden ? 0 : 1)};
`
```

<NextBlock title="Let's look at how styled-jsx solves this."></NextBlock>

## Declarative CSS-in-JS

### No props logic required

[styled-jsx] lets me write CSS in a declarative fashion. It also minimizes the interweaving of CSS and JavaScript code. This, in my opinion, makes styled-jsx code easier-to-understand, even at the modest cost of a little extra verbosity.

How would you style a danger button differently in _styled-jsx_? Just use CSS classes as you normally would. Simple!

```js
const Button = ({ children, danger }) => {
  return (
    <a className={`button ${danger ? 'danger' : ''}`}>
      {children}
      <style jsx>{style}</style>
    </a>
  )
}

const style = css`
  .button {
    background: blue;
  }

  .button.danger {
    background: red;
  }
`
```

> **Logicless CSS-in-JS.** In this example, we simply declare a class rule with `.button.danger`, just as we would with regular CSS. There's no need for the props to be parsed from the CSS block.

## Epilogue

Since writing this article, I've decided that I like the simpler approach of just using [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). The reasons for that is the same as what's in this article: it's as declarative as you can get, and it's compatibility with existing tools is so far unbeatable.
