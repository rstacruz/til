This forces GitHub to always use SSH, even for HTTPS URL's! This way, you can use `https://` GitHub URL's and they will still use your SSH key.

```bash
git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
```

## How it works

When you clone an HTTPS URL, it now gets rewritten as an SSH URL.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rstacruz/vimfiles.git
```

This URL will get rewritten to access via SSH instead of HTTPS. It will instead be fetching from _git@github.com_ via SSH.

## The inverse: Use HTTPS instead of SSH

Alternatively, this forces GitHub to always use HTTPS. Great for macOS, where you can use [git-credential-osxkeychain](https://help.github.com/articles/updating-credentials-from-the-osx-keychain/) to store your GitHub token.

This will _not_ rewrite `git@github.com:user/repo.git` URL's, though, so I don't really recommend it! Besides, SSH keys are often easier to manage than API tokens.

```bash
git config --global url."https://github".insteadOf git://github
```
