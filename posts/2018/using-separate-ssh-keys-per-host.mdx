It's a good idea to keep a different key for every host. That way, should one be compromised, you're not compromising your access to all your hosts. An easy way to do this is to configure your SSH to automatically look for the key based on the host you're connecting to.

## Configuring SSH

Edit the file `~/.ssh/config` and add this `Host *` rule in. Whenever SSH connects to a host, it will now look for a corresponding key in `~/.ssh/key/<user>@<host>`.

```sh
Host *
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/keys/%r@%h
```

### Organize your keys

Put your SSH keys in `~/.ssh/keys/` in the format of `<user>@<host>`. My key folder looks a little bit something like this.

<Figure code title='~/.ssh/keys'>

```
~/.ssh/keys/
├─── git@github.com
├─── git@github.com.pub
├─── rico@staging.server.com
├─── rico@staging.server.com.pub
├─── rsc@10.8.0.1
└─── rsc@10.8.0.1.pub
```

## You're done!

Try it out by connecting to a host that you have a key for.

```sh
$ ssh git@github.com

  Hi rstacruz! You've successfully authenticated, but
  GitHub does not provide shell access.
  Connection to github.com closed.
```

## Generating new keys

To create new keys, simply use `ssh-keygen`. When prompted for where to place files, put them in `<HOME>/.ssh/keys/user@host`. Here's an example.

```sh
$ ssh-keygen

  Generating public/private rsa key pair.
  Enter file in which to save the key: /home/rsc/.ssh/keys/git@bitbucket.org
  Enter passphrase
  ...
```
