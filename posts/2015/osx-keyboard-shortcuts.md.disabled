After switching to OS X, one thing I've always missed in Windows and Linux is the ability to spawn menus using `Alt` `F`. Today I realized that OS X has two ways to accomplish this.

Use `Ctrl` + `F2` to navigate menus with arrow keys, or use `⌘` `⇧` `/` will get you the help menu.

## Useful shortcuts

### Spotlight for menus

The `⌘` `⌥` `/` shortcut is essentially a Spotlight for menu items—it opens the help menu where you can type in the menu item you want. Not all applications support it, though.

### Full keyboard access

Under the _Keyboard_ preference pane, there's an option for _Full Keyboard Access_. I suggest enabling this, as this lets you navigate through file save windows with just the keyboard.

## More shortcuts

| Key         | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| `^` `F1`    | Turn keyboard access on/off |
| `^` `F2`    | Menu bar                    |
| `^` `F3`    | Dock                        |
| `^` `F5`    | Toolbar                     |
| `^` `F6`    | Floating window             |
| `^` `F8`    | Status menu                 |
| `⌘` `⇧` `/` | Help                        |
