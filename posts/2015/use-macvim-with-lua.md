It's always a good idea to install [MacVim] with Lua support. [Homebrew] does not compile with Lua support by default. This gets you the benefit of a noticeably-faster [Unite.vim].

```
brew install macvim --with-cscope --with-lua --override-system-vim --with-luajit --with-python3
```

Also, the option `--override-system-vim` will allow you to use `vim` in the command line apart from the GUI... also a great idea!
